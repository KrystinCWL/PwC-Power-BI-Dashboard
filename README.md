# PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation on Forage

I participated in PwC's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to learn about how to use PowerBI more effectively. I practiced creating a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.

Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working with data visualization using Microsoft PowerBI for diversity and inclusion in the corporate world, and I‚Äôm excited to apply these skills at a company like PwC.

 * Completed a job simulation where I strengthened my PowerBI skills to understand clients and their data visualisation needs better.
 * Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, showcasing the ability to respond to client requests with well-designed solutions.
 * Strong communication skills reflected in the concise and informative email communication with engagement partners, delivering valuable insights and actionable suggestions based on data analysis.
 * Leveraged analytical problem-solving skills to examine HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and identified root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level, highlighting a commitment to data-driven decision-making.
